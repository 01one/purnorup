      <p>Tool</p>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          A full-scale dictionary that works on the web without continuously depending on a server was a challenging
          journey to create. The challenge was that the dictionary data size was more than 25 megabytes, and the loading
          time should not be made longer. Therefore, the data size was reduced to less than 10 megabytes by compressing
          it. However, most web browsers do not natively support zip files yet. In this scenario, JSZip, a JavaScript
          library, helped to overcome this obstacle.

          After loading, this is one of the fastest dictionary you may ever used in a web browser!
          The dictionary data was obtained from Project Gutenberg in a text format. It is a heavyweight book. The words
          were then separated using some simple Python code. You can try it too. Half of the task was already done
          before porting it to the web, as a command-line interface dictionary was created in Python.
          Then it was implemented for browser.

          To obtain accurate results, you must write with accurate spelling.

      <p>Game</p>
      <p>challenging-bricks</p>
      <div class="description">

        <p>Starting the Game: When you load the game, you'll see a "Start Game" button at the center of the screen.
          Click on it to begin the game.

          Controls: Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle left and right, respectively.
          Alternatively, if you are playing on a touchscreen device, you can control the paddle by tapping the left or
          right side of the screen.

          Gameplay: The ball will start bouncing at the top of the screen, and you must guide it using the paddle to
          break the bricks at the top. Each time the ball collides with a brick, the brick disappears, and your score
          increases. Aim to break all the bricks to win the game.

          Ball Movement: The ball will bounce off the walls and the paddle. You need to be quick and accurate in
          controlling the paddle to prevent the ball from falling below it. If the ball passes the paddle and hits the
          bottom of the screen, the game will be over.

          Falling Pieces: Whenever you break a brick, it will shatter into smaller pieces that will fall downwards.
          These falling pieces add an exciting visual effect to the game.

          Shake Effect: As the ball collides with the bricks or walls, the screen will shake momentarily, adding
          intensity to the gameplay. Stay focused and adapt to the shaking screen to maintain control.

          Game Over: If the ball falls below the paddle, then the game will over. It will start again.</p>
